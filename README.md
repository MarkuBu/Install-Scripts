# Install-Scripts
Install scripts to install and configur a basic setup for a mini.iso installation of Ubuntu

This requires a basic installation of Ubuntu with the mini.iso. I usually only add the large fonts and openssl-server.

After reboot you need to install git

    sudo apt install git

Then you need to clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/MarkuBu/Install-Scripts.git

Run the basic install script first

    cd Install-Scripts
    sh basic-install.sh
